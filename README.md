# gpa-calculator
    This is going to calculate your GPA(Grade Point Average). The program consists of I/O streams for input and output.
    It contains array pointers as data structure to hold values. Dynamically Allocated Memory(Heap). The program is made 
    up of functions for individual tasks making the program readable and understandable.

    Formula used for GPA Calculation is: TotalGradePoints / TotalCredits.
        where, 
            TotalGradePoints = sum of((gradePoints * credits) + ...) -> all classes (gradePoints * credits) sum
            TotalCredit = sum of(creditClass1 + creditClass2 + ...)

    And This was my implementation of GPA Calculator.
